# ObjectLink
Application for searching and linking objects from COS, CAMS, and JDE

### To run

Ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed.
Change to your directory

```bash
cd c:\your\directory
```

Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

and then run `webpack-dev-server` to compile and serve the application

```bash
npm run webpack-dev-server
```

This will run webpack with the watch option so modules will be recompiled on change

You can then browse to `http://localhost:8080` to view the application
